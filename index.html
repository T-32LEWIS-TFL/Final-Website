                            This is my example of an Axial typographic system. An Axial typographic system refers to a design approach where text elements are arranged along a central axis or axes. This system is characterised by a strong emphasis on symmetry and balance. The central axis serves as a guide for arranging and aligning text elements, creating a structured and organised layout. </p>

                            This is my example of a Radial typographic system. A Radial typographic system is a design approach where text elements are arranged in a radiating pattern, emanating from a central point. This system is characterised by a dynamic and often unconventional layout that draws attention to the centre and creates a sense of movement. </p>

                            This is my example of a Dilatational typographic system. A Dilatational typographic system is a design approach where text elements are arranged in a circular pattern circling a single point. Additional text usual being stacked atop each other, still in the circular shape. This system is characterised by there being multiple circles to allow different texts to be separated and aligned at different place. </p>

                        <p class="axial-typosym caption">RANDOM —
                            This is my example of a Random typographic system. A Random typographic system refers to a design approach where text elements are placed without a strict or predetermined order, randomly. Often, the text of this typographic system is dispersed and usually placed as if a random generator was deciding the text placement, text often very small, and very large, that also overlay each other. </p>

                        <img class="typosym" src="Typosym/Artboard5.png" alt="Grid typographic system."></img>
                        <p class="axial-typosym caption">GRID —
                            This is my example of a Grid typographic system. A Grid typographic system involves the organising and aligning of text elements on a structured grid. This system relies on a set of horizontal and vertical lines that create a framework for the placement of text. Grid-based typography focuses on ensuring consistency and readability. </p>

                        <p class="axial-typosym caption">MODULAR —
                            This is my example of a Modular typographic system. A Modular typographic system is one that has paragraphs and text ordered and organised into blocks or modules that usually have some sort of container/box shape, easily separating the text from the background and each module/block from each other. The Modular typographic system focuses on readability and consistency but is structured in a way that things are not necessarily read from top to bottom, left to right. </p>

                        <p class="axial-typosym caption">TRANSITIONAL —
                            This is my example of Transitional typographic system. A Transitional typographic system involves the placement and appearance of the text appearing to be that of movement or of something that is moving. The text of the Transitional typographic system tends to prioritise what the shape of the inferred move object is just as much as what the text itself reads and is one of the more creative of the typographic systems. </p>

                            This is my example of Bilateral typographic system. A Bilateral typographic system is one that has its paragraphs and text aligned down the middle. The system focus is on simplicity and readability, similar to the Grid typographic system. </p>

Creating examples of each of the eight typographic systems has expanded my knowledge on the typographic systems, and I know much more on each, and where they could be used. Overall, the eight typographic systems provided good insight to their usage, and what each one was.</p>

In Worksheet 1, what I had to do was to create a GitHub repository on my GitHub account. Through this coding worksheet, I learnt how to create a GitHub repository, commit and push, create a simple html file, and commit and push said file into my newly created repository. In this coding worksheet I learnt the basic aspects of GitHub, and file creation in Visual Studio Code, with a small amount of information of creating a website. This coding worksheet was a starter, despite being short, it was paramount to the understanding of further coding worksheets by going through the basics.</p>

                    <p class="axial-typosym caption">Above is my screenshot documentation of my working websites, my html, and CSS files, and those files in a repository on GitHub. The documentation of Worksheet 2 and 3 was made into one because coding Worksheet 3 was continuation of the coding work done on coding Worksheet 2. In Worksheet 2, what the worksheet had me do was the furtherance of my knowledge in creating the components of a website, i.e., the block level, Inline elements, and the addition of links and images to the website. These being titles, headers, numbered and unnumbered lists. Additionally, the worksheet also got across the importance of save, commit, and pushing work into the GitHub repository, whenever changes are made. In Worksheet 3, what I had to do was create a CSS file, link said file to the previous created html file, placing it in the local repository, and commit and pushing it to GitHub. The worksheet showed how to use a CSS file to create the background colour of a website, change the font and typeface of text in a website, text colour, text style, and images and their size. Through, Worksheet 3 I also learnt how to put images and text into blocks, changing how they are presented, and working through how to, in CSS, display these things in a way that flexes and the website’s tab changes size. In these coding worksheets I learnt more on the application of using html, how to code in it and use many more important aspects of html, that are integral for the creation of working professional websites. The worksheet additionally went over CSS, how to link, and code in it to give websites better appearances. These worksheets were very important in progressing my knowledge in html, introducing me to CSS, and progressing my knowledge of that too. Both of which would be important in furthering my website creation knowledge, to be able to do my next worksheets, and the final website project of my first semester.</p>

                    <p class="axial-typosym caption">Above is my screenshot documentation of my working websites, my html, and CSS files, and those files in a repository on GitHub. The documentation of Worksheet 4 and 5 was made into one because coding Worksheet 5 was continuation of the coding work done on coding Worksheet 4. In Worksheet 4, what I had to do was use Flexbox in menus, style menu items, use flex grow, flex shrink, centre an image on a page, embed a YouTube video, imbed audio, create media items like images with text that accompanies it, create anchor links, and publish something on GitHub. Worksheet 4 went further into html and CSS, and the application of each. This worksheet, just like the previous ones, also made it clear to continuously commit and push to GitHub whenever changes are made. In Worksheet 5, what I had to do was turn lists in buttons, styles said buttons with CSS, adding a footer, adding a link to a button, duplication of the first page to a second, centring a large horizontal image, changing the colour scheme with the use of a wireframe, and using Google and Adobe web fonts in a website. Worksheet 5 further elaborated on the creation of a website. Important things such as being able to create buttons and use fonts from Adobe and Google are indispensable in allowing me to produce exactly what I want, during the website making process. In these final worksheets, I was able to learn more in the process of creating website, using html and CSS. These final worksheets mostly furthered my knowledge in areas of html, and how to create and add new different things to my website which is also seen in other contemporary websites, such as buttons that lead to a link. These worksheets mostly focused on the learning of final basics of html and CSS. Ones that would not necessarily be used in the final website, however, not learning of things that are too specific or specialised.</p>

However, going through the worksheets, I was able to learn many of aspects of website building, what code would be needed to create what in html and CSS, and my knowledge in website pre-production and production. Overall, the importance of these worksheets of my html and CSS coding knowledge, along with my knowledge of GitHub and its use has been insurmountable, and I have learnt to create a basic website using html and CSS.</p>
