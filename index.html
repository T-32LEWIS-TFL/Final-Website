                            This is my example of an Axial typographic system. An Axial typographic system refers to a design approach where text elements are arranged along a central axis or axes. This system is characterised by a strong emphasis on symmetry and balance. The central axis serves as a guide for arranging and aligning text elements, creating a structured and organised layout. </p>

                            This is my example of a Radial typographic system. A Radial typographic system is a design approach where text elements are arranged in a radiating pattern, emanating from a central point. This system is characterised by a dynamic and often unconventional layout that draws attention to the centre and creates a sense of movement. </p>

                            This is my example of a Dilatational typographic system. A Dilatational typographic system is a design approach where text elements are arranged in a circular pattern circling a single point. Additional text usual being stacked atop each other, still in the circular shape. This system is characterised by there being multiple circles to allow different texts to be separated and aligned at different place. </p>

                            This is my example of a Random typographic system. A Random typographic system refers to a design approach where text elements are placed without a strict or predetermined order, randomly. Often, the text of this typographic system is dispersed and usually placed as if a random generator was deciding the text placement, text often very small, and very large, that also overlay each other. </p>

                            This is my example of a Grid typographic system. A Grid typographic system involves the organising and aligning of text elements on a structured grid. This system relies on a set of horizontal and vertical lines that create a framework for the placement of text. Grid-based typography focuses on ensuring consistency and readability. </p>

                            This is my example of a Modular typographic system. A Modular typographic system is one that has paragraphs and text ordered and organised into blocks or modules that usually have some sort of container/box shape, easily separating the text from the background and each module/block from each other. The Modular typographic system focuses on readability and consistency but is structured in a way that things are not necessarily read from top to bottom, left to right. </p>

                            This is my example of Transitional typographic system. A Transitional typographic system involves the placement and appearance of the text appearing to be that of movement or of something that is moving. The text of the Transitional typographic system tends to prioritise what the shape of the inferred move object is just as much as what the text itself reads and is one of the more creative of the typographic systems. </p>

                            This is my example of Bilateral typographic system. A Bilateral typographic system is one that has its paragraphs and text aligned down the middle. The system focus is on simplicity and readability, similar to the Grid typographic system. </p>

Creating examples of each of the eight typographic systems has expanded my knowledge on the typographic systems, and I know much more on each, and where they could be used. Overall, the eight typographic systems provided good insight to their usage, and what each one was.</p>

This poster takes inspiration from that of most posters, with a large subject in the middle, and the main thing to be focused on with, the information of event that the poster is advertising pushed to bottom and the sides, with only the event name itself the ‘Girls Skate Clinc’ being given greater presence in the poster. This poster has most intricate designed background of all three initial ideas, with a purple colour scheme. The text font is sans-serif to improve ease of reading. The text is white, as is the silhouette of the skater, which contrasts with the dark-ish purple background, making them both easier to see. The poster also uses alignment, with the placement of the text. It additionally uses proximity, with the information of the poster conjugating at the bottom part of the poster. This poster lacks repetition, I would add it later when developing this further as my final poster.</p>

This poster also takes inspiration from that of most poster, large subject in the centre (the main focus of the poster), with the information of the poster being placed at side and mainly at the bottom of the poster, much smaller than the centre image. This poster does many things similar to the previous, in shape and structure. A main difference however is the background. The background of this poster is comparatively much brighter than that of poster idea one. The poster uses contrast with colours between the text and the background. This poster uses repetition with the repeating of the skater in the middle of the poster, proximity with the text being next to each other, and alignment of the text and its structure.</p>

                        <p class="first-carpposter caption">This is my third poster idea for the Girls Skate Clinic poster, created in InDesign. This poster, like the last two, takes inspiration from that of the structure and format of most posters, with the main focal subject being in the middle of the poster, consisting of an image. Unlike the other two, I partly used the Axial typographic system in my poster. Having some of the text be written at an angle allows it to be read individually as it contrasts from the rest of the text on the poster. This poster also generally used more contrast, with text that changes from white to black, depending on whether it is on blue and red or white. The text reading ‘Girls Skate Clinic’ also uses a different font and typeface, being serif rather than sans-serif like the rest of the text on the poster, thus contrasting it. This poster also uses alignment and proximity with its placement of its text.</p>

                        <p class="first-carpposter caption">This is final poster for the Girls Skate Clinic poster, the final additions and development done in InDesign. The reason I chose the first poster idea instead of the other two is because its better use of contrast, proximity, and alignment, along with, to my mind, more options in terms of developing and improving on the design, along with adding the repetition that was lacking in it. I did not add to too much, but I made various improvements from the first idea poster. I improved the contrast between the 3rdLair logo and the white band at the bottom. The logo was too bright in the first version, so I darkened to make it more visible. I also added the repetition to the poster that was lacking. I gave it to the focal middle skater character, and to the logo. This repetition giving each more presence, and visibility on the poster, along with making look more interesting. I also did similar things to the general text, however, to lesser degree, only removing the saturation of the colour around the words to make them more visible.</p>

I also gained further knowledge on the creation of a poster, how and where text is placed on a poster, and use aspects of CARP in the poster. Altogether, I was able to learn important aspects of CARP and how to apply them, how to create a poster in InDesign, and gain a further understanding the creation and conventions of posters.</p>

In Worksheet 1, what I had to do was to create a GitHub repository on my GitHub account. Through this coding worksheet, I learnt how to create a GitHub repository, commit and push, create a simple HTML file, and commit and push said file into my newly created repository. In this coding worksheet I learnt the basic aspects of GitHub, and file creation in Visual Studio Code, with a small amount of information of creating a website. This coding worksheet was a starter, despite being short, it was paramount to the understanding of further coding worksheets by going through the basics.</p>

The documentation of Worksheet 2 and 3 was made into one because coding Worksheet 3 was continuation of the coding work done on coding Worksheet 2. In Worksheet 2, what the worksheet had me do was the furtherance of my knowledge in creating the components of a website, i.e., the block level, Inline elements, and the addition of links and images to the website. These being titles, headers, numbered and unnumbered lists. Additionally, the worksheet also got across the importance of save, commit, and pushing work into the GitHub repository, whenever changes are made. In Worksheet 3, what I had to do was create a CSS file, link said file to the previous created HTML file, placing it in the local repository, and commit and pushing it to GitHub. The worksheet showed how to use a CSS file to create the background colour of a website, change the font and typeface of text in a website, text colour, text style, and images and their size. Through, Worksheet 3 I also learnt how to put images and text into blocks, changing how they are presented, and working through how to, in CSS, display these things in a way that flexes and the website’s tab changes size. In these coding worksheets I learnt more on the application of using HTML, how to code in it and use many more important aspects of HTML, that are integral for the creation of working professional websites. The worksheet additionally went over CSS, how to link, and code in it to give websites better appearances. These worksheets were very important in progressing my knowledge in HTML, introducing me to CSS, and progressing my knowledge of that too. Both of which would be important in furthering my website creation knowledge, to be able to do my next worksheets, and the final website project of my first semester.</p>

The documentation of Worksheet 4 and 5 was made into one because coding Worksheet 5 was continuation of the coding work done on coding Worksheet 4. In Worksheet 4, what I had to do was use Flexbox in menus, style menu items, use flex grow, flex shrink, centre an image on a page, embed a YouTube video, imbed audio, create media items like images with text that accompanies it, create anchor links, and publish something on GitHub. Worksheet 4 went further into HTML and CSS, and the application of each. This worksheet, just like the previous ones, also made it clear to continuously commit and push to GitHub whenever changes are made. In Worksheet 5, what I had to do was turn lists in buttons, styles said buttons with CSS, adding a footer, adding a link to a button, duplication of the first page to a second, centring a large horizontal image, changing the colour scheme with the use of a wireframe, and using Google and Adobe web fonts in a website. Worksheet 5 further elaborated on the creation of a website. Important things such as being able to create buttons and use fonts from Adobe and Google are indispensable in allowing me to produce exactly what I want, during the website making process. In these final worksheets, I was able to learn more in the process of creating website, using HTML and CSS. These final worksheets mostly furthered my knowledge in areas of HTML, and how to create and add new different things to my website which is also seen in other contemporary websites, such as buttons that lead to a link. These worksheets mostly focused on the learning of final basics of HTML and CSS. Ones that would not necessarily be used in the final website, however, not learning of things that are too specific or specialised.</p>

                    <p class="axial-typosym caption">On my first week of Graphic and Web Design Studio, I knew little of what entailed website design, and poster design, little of what CARP design meant, little of what the eight typographic systems were, little of what HTML and CSS did, and how to code in them. However, by the end of this semester, I have developed a good understanding of all these things. Throughout this project, I have been able to learn much from and about from each of its components; from the Coding Worksheets, from the CARP Posters, from the examples of the Eight Typographic Systems, and from the Final Website itself. 

                        During the completion of the Coding Worksheets I, as mentioned previously, had little knowledge of how to code in HTML or CSS. Not a single prompt or statement. The Worksheets quickly, however, taught me the basics, starting with Coding Worksheet 1. It enlightened me to the application of GitHub, and how to use it, and how to create a HTML file using Visual Studio Code. The proceeding Worksheets then informed me further on how to build websites, providing me further information on how to position and style things in website. 
                        
                        As the CARP Poster was being completed, I initially had little knowledge of what CARP was and how I could apply it. I, additionally, had not used Adobe programs such as InDesign and had little knowledge on how to use it. I also had only some previous experience create a poster, it not being a regular activity in nor Primary or Secondary school. Working through the creation of the poster, I was able to learn the concepts of CARP and how to apply when in certain works. I was also able, as I was working through the initial creation of three poster ideas, gain better understanding of how to use InDesign in my creation of my posters. Working through this work also enable me to further understand poster design more generally. 
                        
                        While the Eight Typographic Systems were being finished, I initially had little knowledge of the Eight Typographic Systems were and what they entailed. I neither had experience in Adobe Illustrator (program required to make the examples of the Eight Typographic Sytems) or how to use it. Some Typographic Systems were self-explanatory. Ones like radial, random, and modular had names that made it obvious what each would be about, however, this was not necessarily the case with the other five. Nevertheless, working through the Eight Typographic Systems, and creating the examples in Adobe Illustrator, I was about to learn how to use it, and what each of the Typographic Systems were and understand how I would be able to use them in future work. 
                        
                        In conclusion, I have learnt much on my journey through this project. I initially knew little on any of the components of the project, or the programs that I would need to know to create them. However, my knowledge of the Eight Typographic Systems, poster design, coding with CSS and HTML, website design, Adobe Illustrator, and Adobe InDesign has improved massively, with me having a good understanding of all involved. Overall, I can say that I have been a to learn about each part of the project, being a much greater position than I started the project.</p>
